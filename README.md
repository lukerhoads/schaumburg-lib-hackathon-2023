## Inspiration
Our group agreed that taking part in clubs can sometimes be a bureaucratic process that puts a burden on  interested students. We thought that a web app that schools can use to list their clubs would be a good way for students to find their voice through increased participation in their school club community.

## What it does
ClubMaster provides students, schools, and sponsors a way to manage clubs. Schools can join the platform through an administrator, and from there students can also begin joining the platform under their school email. As students join and create clubs, our platform easily allows sponsors to become the head of the club. As a member of the club, you are also able to make posts, which enables those who are in the club to find their voice.

## How we built it
We used Python Flask and Jinja2 in order to handle requests and render the frontend. We used Firebase  as our database to store and access information on the cloud.

## Challenges we ran into
We had a teammate that unfortunately had to leave. This created a role that needed to be filled. Also, getting going with Flask and Jinja2 was kind of slow because we had to get up to speed with it, as some of our teammates had used it a long time ago.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the platform that we created in a couple days that allows students to find their voice through participation in their school club community!

## What we learned
We learned the how-tos of this tech stack. We also learned to use Firebase Firestore with ease using Python.

## What's next for ClubMaster
ClubMaster really needs a way to reach out to sponsors to join clubs so students do not have to do it themselves. Also, the tagging feature where sponsors open themselves up to leading certain clubs has not been developed. We are also yet to implement additional features such as profile pages, profile picture customization, content filtering, and more.
